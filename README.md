Monax maintains Bosmarmot a satellite monorepo to 
[Burrow](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow) that contains:

* burrow.js - a Javascript client library for interacting with Burrow smart contracts
* Vent - an EVM event to SQL database mapping layer - currently under development.

If you are looking for `bos`, this has been replaced by `burrow deploy` in
[Burrow](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow).

## Working with Javascript - Burrow.js

Please see the [burrow.js readme](burrow.js/README.md) within this repo.
